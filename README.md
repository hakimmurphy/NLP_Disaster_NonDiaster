# NLP_Disaster_NonDiaster
This repository contains a complete end‑to‑end pipeline for detecting disaster‑reladd tweets. Starting from raw, labeled Twitter data, we perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), text preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation, culminating in a reliable classifier based on TF–IDF and Logistic Regression.
